Project: Local chess Web Application

Technical Requirements:
- TypeScript implementation
- Local web application (no server required)
- Two player support (alternating turns on same machine)
- Clean separation of game logic and UI

Development Process:
1. Implement core game logic first:
   - Game state management
   - Move validation
   - Win condition checking
2. Create UI components after logic verification
3. Use Puppeteer only for UI testing and validation (use port 7766)
4. Take viewport-specific screenshots for UI analysis

Testing Requirements:
- Use Puppeteer strictly for UI testing
- Capture and analyze screenshots for UI verification
- Test game logic independently of UI
- Verify win conditions and draw scenarios

Project Structure:
- Use current working directory
- Maintain separate logic and UI components
- Implement proper TypeScript types

Break this project into small, focused subtasks. Verify each component before moving forward.
Report results and any issues encountered during development.

I WANT IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. NO FANCY STUFF. JUST THE BARE MINIMUM. Use chess emojis for the pieces.

whenever you execute logic - plan ahead by adding a comment.
what are the step you are going to take?
can you send it to a subtask?
what is the current status?
do not hesitate to spawn subtasks. it makes the context lighter and easier to manage.
